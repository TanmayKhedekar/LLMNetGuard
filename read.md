### **How to Integrate LLMNetGuard with Postman for Network Threat Detection**

In todayâ€™s digital age, network security is paramount. **LLMNetGuard**, a network threat detection system powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, helps identify security threats by analyzing network traffic. With Postman, a versatile tool for API testing, you can interact with the LLMNetGuard API seamlessly. In this blog, we'll walk you through how to set up and test the **LLMNetGuard** API using Postman.

---

#### **What is LLMNetGuard?**
LLMNetGuard is an advanced threat detection system that uses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to classify and analyze network traffic, detecting potential security threats. By analyzing packets such as IP, protocol, and port details, the system predicts whether the network traffic is safe or suspicious.

---

#### **Step 1: Set Up Your API Endpoint**

Before you can test with Postman, ensure your **LLMNetGuard** API is running. If you're using **FastAPI** as your backend, your API should be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` if running locally. The API exposes a **/predict** endpoint that accepts a **POST** request with packet information in JSON format.

For example, your **FastAPI** code might look like this:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/predict/")
async def predict(text: str):
    # Perform packet analysis here and return the prediction
    return {"text": text, "predicted_label": 1}
```

This endpoint will analyze the packet details and return a prediction about whether the traffic is normal or suspicious.

#### **Step 2: Launch Postman**

If you haven't already, **download and install Postman** from the official [Postman website](https://www.postman.com/). Postman is an API development and testing tool that makes it easy to send requests and analyze responses.

---

#### **Step 3: Create a New Request in Postman**

1. Open Postman and click **New** in the top left.
2. Select **Request**.
3. Name your request (e.g., **Network Threat Detection**).
4. Choose or create a folder to save the request.
5. Click **Save**.

---

#### **Step 4: Configure the POST Request**

In the newly created request, configure the following:

- **Method**: Select `POST`.
- **URL**: Enter `http://127.0/predict/` (or replace with your API URL if deployed remotely).
- **Headers**:
  - Set `Content-Type` to `application/json`.

---

#### **Step 5: Add JSON Body**

Go to the **Body** tab in Postman, select **raw**, and choose **JSON** as the format. Then, enter a JSON object with the packet information you want to analyze. For example:

```json
{
  "text": "Ether / IPv6.......................... / Raw"
}
```

This JSON contains the packet details that LLMNetGuard will classify. You can replace this with real-time packet data captured from your network.

---

#### **Step 6: Send the Request**

Click the **Send** button in Postman to submit the request to the **LLMNetGuard** API. Your API should analyze the packet and respond with the classification.

---

#### **Step 7: View the Response**

Once the request is processed, Postman will display the response in the **Response** tab. For example:

```json
{
  "text": "Ether / IPv6 / ...................... / Raw",
  "predicted_label": 1
}
```

In this response, the `predicted_label` indicates the classification: `1` for normal and `0` for suspicious. Use this information to assess the network packet's safety.

---

#### **Step 8: Troubleshooting**

If you receive an error (like a 400 or 500 status code), check the API for issues or ensure that your packet information is correctly formatted. Common errors might include malformed JSON or missing fields.

If you receive unexpected results from the prediction, revisit your model and training dataset to ensure it's accurately classifying the network traffic.

---

### **Conclusion**

Integrating **LLMNetGuard** with **Postman** allows you to test and analyze your network traffic predictions easily. By sending sample packet data to the **/predict** endpoint, you can see how well your model identifies suspicious activity, enhancing your network security. Postman provides a simple yet powerful interface to interact with your API, making it an essential tool for testing and refining your network threat detection system.

With **LLMNetGuard**, you're one step closer to proactive network security. Happy testing!
